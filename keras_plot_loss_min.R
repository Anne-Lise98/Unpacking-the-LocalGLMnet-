#This function plots the validation and training loss for the neural networks and LocalGLMnets, indicating the epoch at which we obtain the smallest validation loss. 
#This function is replicated from the code written by J. Schelldorfer and M. V. WÃ¼thrich, corresponding to their article 
#"LocalGLMnet: a deep learning architecture for actuaries". 
#The original code can be found here: https://github.com/JSchelldorfer/ActuarialDataScience/tree/master/10%20-%20LocalGLMnet
